Before doing anything: 

Make sure you have epssBound and the GaussionMapping.m files (included in this directory).

The epssBound file contains the  boundary conditions for the fracturing case,
but you can modify it to your liking and the conditions you need.

Run the Matlab script, this will create a clean epss (solid fraction) file which then you can copy
into the 0/ directory within your simulations.
